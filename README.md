I record my progress and answers in leetcode

## Current Important Things
1. Watch others do it. Seek not an immediate solution but from brute force to OK to the optimal solution
2. Solve by frequencies (most frequent 200), not by tags. Tags give you hints which you should be thinking of on your own
